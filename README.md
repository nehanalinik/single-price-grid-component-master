## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned rem's and em's and got to know that rem are most useful once and declaring the font-size in the root element of the html tag helped me not to specify font-size to each and every element in every media query.
Simply change the html font size in the breakpoints.
Makes life must simpler ðŸ™‚.

```css
html {
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on GRIDS and FLEX Box!! in my upcoming projects.(indeed much powerful concepts)

### Useful resources

- [CSS matic](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me in completing box-shadows. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand Grids. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept and I'm looking forwards to learn more from this article.
